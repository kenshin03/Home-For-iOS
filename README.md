===============================

![Screenshot](cover_image.png)


This is an attempt to replicate essential elements of the Facebook Home experience in iOS as an app. The aim is to re-create features like Cover Feed with nothing but simple UIKit 
controls and the Facebook Graph API.

I will be updating this documentation and writing development notes at:
